# SendGrid Email Service Fix

## Issue Fixed
- **Problem**: Emails were not being sent to selected authorities
- **Root Cause**: SendGrid API key was set to placeholder value `"your-sendgrid-api-key-here"` in `.env` file
- **Solution**: Updated `.env` file with correct SendGrid API key

## Changes Made

### 1. Environment Configuration
- Updated `SENDGRID_API_KEY` in `.env` file with actual API key
- Created `.env.example` file with placeholder values for reference

### 2. Email Service Verification
- Tested email service functionality with `test_real_email.py`
- Confirmed SendGrid API key format validation (starts with "SG.")
- Verified email sending works correctly

### 3. Backend Service
- Restarted backend server to load updated environment variables
- Confirmed email service initialization without errors

## Email Flow
1. **Frontend**: User selects authorities and clicks "Send Email to Selected"
2. **API Call**: POST request to `/send-authority-emails` endpoint
3. **Backend**: Processes request and sends personalized emails via SendGrid
4. **Result**: Authorities receive formatted email notifications

## Files Modified
- `.env` - Updated SendGrid API key
- `.env.example` - Created template file (NEW)
- `SENDGRID_FIX.md` - This documentation (NEW)

## Testing
- ✅ SendGrid API key validation passed
- ✅ Direct email test successful
- ✅ Backend server running without email errors
- ✅ Frontend ready for authority email testing

## Next Steps
- Test complete email flow through frontend UI
- Monitor email delivery in production
- Consider adding email delivery status tracking
